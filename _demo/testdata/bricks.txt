                ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND                          Lewis Carroll               THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 2.9                            CHAPTER I                      Down the Rabbit-Hole  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sisteron the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she hadpeeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had nopictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whetherthe pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the troubleof getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a WhiteRabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alicethink it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say toitself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thoughtit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to havewondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started toher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had neverbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch totake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across thefield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it popdown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.  In another moment down went Alice after it, never onceconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not amoment to think about stopping herself before she found herselffalling down a very deep well.  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for shehad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and towonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to lookdown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark tosee anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, andnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  Shetook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it waslabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment itwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killingsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as shefell past it.  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, Ishall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'llall think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likelytrue.)  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `Iwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Letme see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in herlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY goodopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one tolisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitudeor Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words tosay.)  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall rightTHROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among thepeople that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, Ithink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, thistime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shallhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she triedto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're fallingthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And whatan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'llnever do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soonbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, Ishould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll rememberher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you weredown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, butyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to getrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort ofway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Dobats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer eitherquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She feltthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that shewas walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her veryearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat abat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap ofsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in amoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before herwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still insight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear itsay, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how lateit's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned thecorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she foundherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lampshanging from the roof.  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up theother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,wondering how she was ever to get out again.  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made ofsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of thedoors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, orthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any ofthem.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a lowcurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a littledoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden keyin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a smallpassage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down andlooked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander aboutamong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, butshe could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even ifmy head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be ofvery little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wishI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I onlyknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way thingshad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very fewthings indeed were really impossible.  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so shewent back to the table, half hoping she might find another key onit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up liketelescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`whichcertainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neckof the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'beautifully printed on it in large letters.  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise littleAlice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll lookfirst,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';for she had read several nice little histories about children whohad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasantthings, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rulestheir friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot pokerwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut yourfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she hadnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner orlater.  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice venturedto taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sortof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roastturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finishedit off.     		*       		*       		*       		*       		*       		*       		*         		*       		*       		*       		*       		*       		*     		*       		*       		*       		*       		*       		*       		*  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting uplike a telescope.'  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, andher face brightened up at the thought that she was now the rightsize for going though the little door into that lovely garden.First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she wasgoing to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous aboutthis; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in mygoing out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should belike then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle islike after the candle is blown out, for she could not rememberever having seen such a thing.  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decidedon going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! whenshe got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little goldenkey, and when she went back to the table for it, she found shecould not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainlythrough the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of thelegs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she hadtired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down andcried.  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice toherself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she veryseldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself soseverely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she rememberedtrying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a gameof croquet she was playing against herself, for this curiouschild was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's nouse now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectableperson!'  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying underthe table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, onwhich the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creepunder the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and Idon't care which happens!'  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Whichway?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head tofeel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised tofind that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generallyhappens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into theway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in thecommon way.  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.     		*       		*       		*       		*       		*       		*       		*         		*       		*       		*       		*       		*       		*     		*       		*       		*       		*       		*       		*       		*                           CHAPTER II                        The Pool of Tears  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so muchsurprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak goodEnglish); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope thatever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at herfeet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting sofar off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put onyour shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan'tbe able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myselfabout you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must bekind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk theway I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair ofboots every Christmas.'  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'llseem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd thedirections will look!            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.                HEARTHRUG,                    NEAR THE FENDER,                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  infact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once tookup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.  Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on oneside, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to getthrough was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began tocry again.  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a greatgirl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying inthis way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on allthe same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large poolall round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down thehall.  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in thedistance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with apair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in theother:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering tohimself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't shebe savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperatethat she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbitcame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kidgloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hardas he could go.  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was veryhot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterdaythings went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed inthe night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up thismorning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a littledifferent.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who inthe world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she beganthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same ageas herself, to see if she could have been changed for any ofthem.  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in suchlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'msure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all thethings I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, theMultiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have beenchanged for Mabel!  I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse andstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--            `How doth the little crocodile              Improve his shining tail,            And pour the waters of the Nile              On every golden scale!            `How cheerfully he seems to grin,              How neatly spread his claws,            And welcome little fishes in              With gently smiling jaws!'  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, andher eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabelafter all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky littlehouse, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever somany lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'mMabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting theirheads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"  I shall only lookup and say "Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if Ilike being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay downhere till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with asudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their headsdown!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and wassurprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's littlewhite kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have donethat?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got upand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that thecause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped ithastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened atthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still inexistence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speedback to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shutagain, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table asbefore, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declareit's too bad, that it is!'  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in anothermoment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  He firstidea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in thatcase I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice hadbeen to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the generalconclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you finda number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging inthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, andbehind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out thatshe was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was ninefeet high.  `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, Isuppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queerthing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool alittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  atfirst she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but thenshe remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out thatit was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to thismouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I shouldthink very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm intrying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out ofthis pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered havingseen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to amouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her ratherinquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its littleeyes, but it said nothing.  `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `Idaresay it's a French mouse, come over with William theConqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice hadno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So shebegan again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence inher French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of thewater, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I begyour pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt thepoor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionatevoice.  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't beangry about it.  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring sonicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--andshe is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capitalone for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she feltcertain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her anymore if you'd rather not.'  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the endof his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our familyalways HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hearthe name again!'  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change thesubject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There issuch a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curlybrown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, andit'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--Ican't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, youknow, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in asorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For theMouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, andmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went.  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come backagain, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don'tlike them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swamslowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alicethought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get tothe shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'llunderstand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowdedwith the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were aDuck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curiouscreatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to theshore.                           CHAPTER III                  A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on thebank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with theirfur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, anduncomfortable.  The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  theyhad a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemedquite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly withthem, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she hadquite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was nomore to be said.  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority amongthem, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LLsoon make you dry enough!'  They all sat down at once, in a largering, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice kept her eyesanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a badcold if she did not get dry very soon.  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?This is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round, if you please!"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, wassoon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had beenof late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin andMorcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.  `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but verypolitely:  `Did you speak?'  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.  `I thought you did,' said the Mouse.  `--I proceed.  "Edwin andMorcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, foundit advisable--"'  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.  `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course youknow what "it" means.'  `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' saidthe Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,what did the archbishop find?'  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet Williamand offer him the crown.  William's conduct at first wasmoderate.  But the insolence of his Normans--"  How are yougetting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as itspoke.  `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn'tseem to dry me at all.'  `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `Imove that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of moreenergetic remedies--'  `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know the meaning ofhalf those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you doeither!'  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:some of the other birds tittered audibly.  `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'  `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted muchto know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODYought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winterday, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`theexact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the partywere placed along the course, here and there.  There was no `One,two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to knowwhen the race was over.  However, when they had been running halfan hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly calledout `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,and asking, `But who has won?'  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal ofthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed uponits forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.  Atlast the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must haveprizes.'  `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voicesasked.  `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice withone finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her handin her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the saltwater had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.There was exactly one a-piece all round.  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else haveyou got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.  `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodosolemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance ofthis elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this shortspeech, they all cheered.  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all lookedso grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could notthink of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,looking as solemn as she could.  The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noiseand confusion, as the large birds complained that they could nottaste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted onthe back.  However, it was over at last, and they sat down againin a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, halfafraid that it would be offended again.  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning toAlice, and sighing.  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down withwonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?'  Andshe kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, sothat her idea of the tale was something like this:--                    `Fury said to a                   mouse, That he                 met in the               house,            "Let us              both go to                law:  I will                  prosecute                    YOU.  --Come,                       I'll take no                        denial; We                     must have a                 trial:  For              really this           morning I've          nothing         to do."           Said the             mouse to the               cur, "Such                 a trial,                   dear Sir,                         With                     no jury                  or judge,                would be              wasting             our              breath."               "I'll be                 judge, I'll                   be jury,"                         Said                    cunning                      old Fury:                     "I'll                      try the                         whole              #

def open(file, mode='r', buffering=None, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True): # known special case of open
    """
    Open file and return a stream.  Raise OSError upon failure.
    
    file is either a text or byte string giving the name (and the path
    if the file isn't in the current working directory) of the file to
    be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be
    wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the
    returned I/O object is closed, unless closefd is set to False.)
    
    mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file
    is opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text
    mode.  Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if
    it already exists), 'x' for creating and writing to a new file, and
    'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes
    append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position).
    In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform
    dependent: locale.getpreferredencoding(False) is called to get the
    current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary
    mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available modes are:
    
    ========= ===============================================================
    Character Meaning
    --------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
    'r'       open for reading (default)
    'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
    'x'       create a new file and open it for writing
    'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
    'b'       binary mode
    't'       text mode (default)
    '+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
    'U'       universal newline mode (deprecated)
    ========= ===============================================================
    
    The default mode is 'rt' (open for reading text). For binary random
    access, the mode 'w+b' opens and truncates the file to 0 bytes, while
    'r+b' opens the file without truncation. The 'x' mode implies 'w' and
    raises an `FileExistsError` if the file already exists.
    
    Python distinguishes between files opened in binary and text modes,
    even when the underlying operating system doesn't. Files opened in
    binary mode (appending 'b' to the mode argument) return contents as
    bytes objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when
    't' is appended to the mode argument), the contents of the file are
    returned as strings, the bytes having been first decoded using a
    platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given.
    
    'U' mode is deprecated and will raise an exception in future versions
    of Python.  It has no effect in Python 3.  Use newline to control
    universal newlines mode.
    
    buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy.
    Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select
    line buffering (only usable in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate
    the size of a fixed-size chunk buffer.  When no buffering argument is
    given, the default buffering policy works as follows:
    
    * Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer
      is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device's
      "block size" and falling back on `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.
      On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.
    
    * "Interactive" text files (files for which isatty() returns True)
      use line buffering.  Other text files use the policy described above
      for binary files.
    
    encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the
    file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is
    platform dependent, but any encoding supported by Python can be
    passed.  See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings.
    
    errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding errors are to
    be handled---this argument should not be used in binary mode. Pass
    'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error
    (the default of None has the same effect), or pass 'ignore' to ignore
    errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.)
    See the documentation for codecs.register or run 'help(codecs.Codec)'
    for a list of the permitted encoding error strings.
    
    newline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text
    mode). It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as
    follows:
    
    * On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is
      enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and
      these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
      caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
      endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
      the _char legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
      string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.
    
    * On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
      translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
      newline is '' or '\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any
      of the _char legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated
      to the given string.
    
    If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open
    when the file is closed. This does not work when a file name is given
    and must be True in that case.
    
    A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as *opener*. The
    underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by
    calling *opener* with (*file*, *flags*). *opener* must return an open
    file descriptor (passing os.open as *opener* results in functionality
    similar to passing None).
    
    open() returns a file object whose type depends on the mode, and
    through which the standard file operations such as reading and writing
    are performed. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ('w',
    'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), it returns a TextIOWrapper. When used to open
    a file in a binary mode, the returned class varies: in read binary
    mode, it returns a BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary
    modes, it returns a BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns
    a BufferedRandom.
    
    It is also possible to use a string or bytearray as a file for both
    reading and writing. For strings StringIO can be used like a file
    opened in a text mode, and for bytes a BytesIO can be used like a file
    opened in a binary mode.
